# React + TypeScript + Vite

Hi dear Zarban developers
// //

file and folder structure 

for file and folder structure i decide to use atomic design 
-  reusability of components
- consistency in the ui 
- better and simpler possible improvements in the project
- understand the project for new developer (in the future)


.....................................

How you run it

the npm run command start the development server

to build you can npm run build

......................................

Branch strategy would be github flow

production => main

for add new feature name of the branch must be like this

feature/{branch-name} | 

bugfix/{name-of-the-bug} | 

for add a new tool  implementation/{add-test} |

config/{the-cheanged-config file /or add a plug in to vite}

CICD/{for add or improvement in ci cd files }

reflactor/{the part of app or feature should be reflector include folder strucher source code ... }
